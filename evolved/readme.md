evolve-D
======================

Evolve-D(earborn) encapsulates simplicity, function, and style as it unites many notable Moodle theme features into an evolved "More" theme. Evolve-D applies famed theme elements such as custom frontpage, Google Fonts, My Courses dropdown, block icons, and a variety of other enhancements made popular in Essential and Aardvark Themes.  The evolve-D theme's appeal comes from it's simple 2 column design, muted colors, and focus on displaying content and minimizing distractions.

[Dearborn Public Schools](http://dearbornschools.org) is a K-12 school distict in Dearborn, Michigan. We designed and use evolve-D on our Moodle site.

Special thanks to [Aardvark](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_aardvark) and [Essential](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_essential) theme developers Shaun Daubney and Julian Ridden for thier work which is replicated in part here.

evolve-D v2 "Dearborn Public Schools"
======================
In the Moodle 2.7 version the custom dashboard feature was accidently removed.  This version fixes that for the Moodle 2.7 version and puts the dashboard feature back in.  In Moodle 2.8 the dashboard menu is intentionally removed due to Moodle including this by default.  Unless there are bug fixes this will be the last Moodle 2.7 update.  All future updates will be on the Moodle 2.8 version of this theme.
